Troubleshooting piddlePIL


"bad font!" error: this means that piddlePIL can't find a requested font.
All the test cases use valid fonts, so this indicates a problem with the
installation.  This often happens on Macs when the font files in the
pilfonts folder are mistakenly unpacked as text files, rather than as
binary files.  StuffIt Expander makes this mistake; probably 'tar' does
not.  If you use a Mac and suffer from this problem, write to me at
<joe@strout.net> and I'll help you out.  Suggestions on better ways to
prevent this would be greatly appreciated.



Other problems?  Write to joe@strout.net or the piddle mailing list.
