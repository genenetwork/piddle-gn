<h3>Abstract</h3>
<b>PIDDLE</b> is a <b><a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a></b> module
for creating two-dimensional graphics in a manner that is both cross-platform
and cross-media; that is, it can support screen graphics (e.g. QuickDraw,
Windows, Tk) as well as file output (PostScript, PDF, GIF, etc.). It makes use
of the native 2D drawing calls of each backend, for maximum efficiency and
quality. It works by defining a base class (piddle.Canvas) with methods for
all supported drawing primitives. A particular drawing context is provided in
the form of a derived class. PIDDLE applications will be able to automatically
select an appropriate backend for the user's environment. <br>

<h3>NEWS</h3>

<b> 2002-02-08: </b> After a long hiatus, I've uploaded version
1.0.14.  This is the first version to use distutils.  Installation
should now be as easy as "python setup.py install" I've also thrown in
more exprimental backends--better to get them out there than just have
them languish. The new backends include SVG, GTK, Xfig, and improved
TK support.  Thanks to all who contributed code!  Note, I've dropped
the "b" marking the beta nature of the distribution.  Got tired of
keeping track of whether it's a beta package or not.  You should view
the documentation to see which backends are solid and which are
exprimental (see below).


Because of the not-so-positive connotations of the name "piddle", I have put
together a a development version with the same functionality and interface
under the the name "SPING" (Simple Platform Independent Graphics).  I'm
looking for feedback on the name choice and if you have a better name, please
let us know on the piddle mailing list <a
href="mailto:pythonpiddle@yahoogroups.com"> pythonpiddle@yahoogroups.com </a>. In
addition to the name change, Sping is designed to be used as a python package
and is being developed using the Python Imaging Library version 1.1.  To make
it easier to use PIL 1.1 on Windows, I've made a binary version of PIL 1.1
available as well (compiled under tk/tcl version 8.0.5).  You can download the
latest versions of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/piddle/"><b> Sping </b> </a> and <a href="PIL"> <b> PIL-1.1-win32-bin </b></a>.  If you have problems reaching these links go to <a
href="downloads/"> the alternative download page </a>.

<p><strong><span style="color: #FF0000">Important note</span></strong>: Sping
1.1.x, with it's odd numbered point release,  is the <em>development
branch</em> of piddle, also known as the unstable branch.  Stick with the
piddle-1.x releases if you require more guarantees of a stable and fixed api.
On the other hand, if you need new features, Sping-1.1.x is where they'll be
added.</p>

<h3>Status</h3> PIDDLE is reaching the end of beta testing and with the 1.0
stable release of select backends coming soon (4th quarter 2000 is the current
best guess). The PDF, PIL, wxWindows, PS, TK, and Quick Draw backends are solid.
The other backends will be included in the 1.0 distribution with opportunities
for further development in the development version (versions 1.1.x).  If you do
find a bug still lurking, please send email to the <a
href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pythonpiddle"> PIDDLE mailing list
</a> at <a href="mailto:pythonpiddle@yahoogroups.com"> pythonpiddle@yahoogroups.com
</a>.

<h3>Piddle and Python 2.0</h3>

<p>Piddle itself works perfectly with Python 2.0 and above.  If you are upgrading, make
sure to upgrade/recompile any extension modules that you wish to use (e.g. 
PIL) so that they work with Python 2.0 as well. </p>

<h3><a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/piddle/">Downloads</a></h3>
<ul>
<li> The latest stable is available from our Source Forge download page <a
href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/piddle"> here</a> in
the form of .zip and .tgz archives.  If you receive a "security error" when
attempting to access the download page, your browser probably does not support
the "https" protocol.  You may download <a href="downloads/"> from the
alternative download page </a> instead. </li>

<li> You may also want to look at <a
href="http://piddle.sourceforge.net/developer"> CVS access and other
information for developers</a> if you want the latest experimental
version.  Visit the <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/piddle/">Sourceforge Project
Page </a> at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/piddle/">
https://sourceforge.net/projects/piddle/ </a> to submit or view bug
reports. </li>
<li> PIL support: PIL binaries for win32 are available from the <a href="PIL"> PIL downloads page </a> </li>
</ul>

<p>As of Febuary 8, 2002, the current release is <b> 1.0.14 </b>, however,
see the download page for the latest information.</p>

<p>As of 12 December 2000, the current release is <b> 1.0b13 </b>, however,
see the download page for the latest information.</p>

<p>Please note that <b>PIDDLE requires Python 1.5.2</b>, because it uses the
"extend" list method, which is not available in older versions of Python.  In addition, it now includes distutils support which can be added to Python 1.5.2, but which comes by default with versions 1.6, 2.0 and above.</p>

<p>The standard distribution includes the following back-end renderers:</p>

<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
<ul>
  <b>[5]</b> winpiddle's string drawing is having some trouble with size and
  color attributes; also, the text background is not transparent as it should
  be. Unclear whether rotated strings are supported yet.

  <p><b>[6]</b> piddleGTK doesn't yet draw rotated strings, but it is
  planned.</p>

<p><b>[7]</b> piddleFIG string widths are wrong at the moment
<p> <b> [8] </b> piddleFIG images must be stored separately from the .fig file itself
since the .fig format only allows images to be included by referring to
them by filename
</ul>

<h3>Usage Overview</h3>
PIDDLE is designed for vector graphics -- i.e., drawing of primitives such as
lines and ellipses, rather than manipulation of individual pixels. Generally,
one creates a PIDDLE drawing in four steps:
<ol>
  <li>instantiate a class derived from piddle.Canvas</li>
  <li>call drawing methods on that object, such as drawLine or drawString</li>
  <li>flush the canvas's buffer (i.e., flush the graphics pipeline, update the
    screen, or whatever)</li>
  <li>Save the canvas's current view to a file if one is desired.</li>
</ol>
Note that while PIDDLE is easiest to use in a noninteractive mode -- i.e.,
simply generating charts, pictures, or other static displays -- some backends
support callback methods invoked when the mouse moves over or clicks on the
drawing. This allows for some graphical interaction with the user. The canvas
save() operation is most relevant to file-based backends (e.g. piddlePDF)
while the flush() command is most relevant to backends that produce on-screen
graphics.

<p></p>

<h3>Developer's Overview</h3>
Creating a new PIDDLE backend is relatively easy. You must create a class
derived from piddle.Canvas, and instantiate at least the following methods:
<ul>
  <li><b>drawLine</b></li>
  <li><b>drawPolygon</b></li>
  <li><b>drawImage</b></li>
  <li><b>drawString</b></li>
</ul>
All other drawing methods will have default implementations in terms of the
functions above. However, you may wish to also override other drawing methods
for the sake of efficiency or quality.
